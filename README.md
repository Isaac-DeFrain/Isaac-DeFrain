# Hello

I'm Isaac (he/him). Welcome to my GitHub page!

# Work-related Interests

I have many work-related interests, including, but not limited to:

- distributed systems
- compilers, interpreters, and DSLs
- proof-of-stake consensus algorithms
- dependent types and theorem provers
- functional programming (especially OCaml and Rust)
- formal specification, model checking, and trace checking

My formal training is in pure mathematics (complex analysis), but I thoroughly enjoy software engineering too :)

# Non-work-related Interests

Outside of work you will find me rock climbing, hiking, road biking, watching a variety of TV shows and movies, and learning. I am always learning. I am endlessly fascinated by the following topics (in no particular order):

- mathematics
- activism and politics
- surveillance capitalism
- fitness, nutrition, and health
- cults, hate groups, and religious extremism
- blockchain/cryptocurrency (I know this is work-related...)
- history and the general process of how things came to be the way they are
