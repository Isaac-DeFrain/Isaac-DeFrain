# Hello

I'm Isaac (he/him). Welcome to my GitHub!

# Work-related Interests

I have many work-related interests, including, but not limited to:

- distributed systems
- byzantine fault tolerance
- concurrency and process calculi
- compilers, interpreters, and DSLs
- protocol design and implementation
- proof-of-stake consensus algorithms
- dependent types and theorem provers
- functional programming (especially OCaml and Scala)
- formal specification/verification, model checking, and trace checking

My formal training is in pure mathematics (complex analysis, differential geometry), but I thoroughly enjoy software engineering too :)

# Non-work-related Interests

Outside of work you will find me rock climbing, hiking, road biking, watching a variety of TV shows and movies, and learning. I am always learning. I am endlessly fascinated by the following topics (in no particular order):

- mathematics
- quantum mechanics
- data privacy policy
- surveillance capitalism
- nuclear nonproliferation
- fitness, nutrition, and health
- activism, politics, and civil liberties
- social impacts of blockchain/cryptocurrency
- cults, hate groups, fascism, and religious extremism
- history and the general process of how things came to be the way they are
